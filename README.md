This is an R package for amusing quotes from the hit 2010 movie
[MacGruber](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470023/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1).
Essentially this is a wittier version of
[fortunes](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fortunes/) and proof of
concept of the ease in creating an R package in
[Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).
